# Nature Hero

[![NPM version][badge-npm]][info-npm]

The Nature Hero component appears at the top of the page on all Nature journal sites.

It consists of:
- an `<h2>` article title which links to the full article
- a summary of the article, which appears underneath the title
- an image

Nature editors decide on the content and image that goes in the Hero component on each journal site. They can add and update this content in a tool called PubServ.
